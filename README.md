Michaelmira_push_through

Push Through is a game created by the Caballeros Coding Company.
Michael J Mirisciotta and Robert M Sylvester.

This Two person game integrates the logic of the classic household game Connect 4, with a new state of the art four dimentional spin.

One new thing to expect that you can push pieces from one playing dimension to the next dimension, this makes the game highly complex where you can feel free to impliment higher level stratgeies.

Be prepared to take on your favorite buddy, in this new game that will test your brain power to the limit!

1. ASCII board should loop through all boards

2. Start writing high level functions for applying a move
    A. validate if move is okay
    B. apply gravity to move.
        self.drop_piece(board_idx, col_idx, player)
        apply_gravity() will return the actual row_idx and col_idx of the piece when it falls down
        process_move() is applied on the fall
